//! Read-only handle the control accept loop holds, so pure-snapshot `show_*`
//! queries can render off the rx_loop hot path instead of round-tripping the
//! mpsc → rx_loop oneshot.
//!
//! The handle bundles the node state that is independently shareable, plus one
//! `ArcSwap` snapshot cell per read subsystem:
//!
//! - `context` / `metrics` — already `Arc`-shared.
//! - `stats` — `ArcSwap<StatsSnapshot>`: stats_history dual-ring + the scalar
//!   gauges `show_status` needs, published from the tick.
//! - `routing` — `ArcSwap<RoutingSnapshot>`: tree / bloom / coord / identity,
//!   published from the tick.
//! - `entities` — `ArcSwap<EntitySnapshot>`: peers / sessions / links /
//!   connections / transports, published from the tick with `Vec<Arc<Row>>`
//!   structural sharing.
//! - `native` — `ArcSwap<NativeSnapshot>`: native datagram API flows and
//!   listeners, published from the tick because the registry never leaves the
//!   rx_loop.
//!
//! Publisher placement: all four snapshot cells are published from the
//! periodic tick, which runs as one arm of the rx_loop's `select!`. Publishing
//! therefore costs the rx_loop; what the handle removes is the read-side round
//! trip out to the rx_loop and back, not the cost of publishing. The
//! `publish_routing_snapshot` and `publish_entities_snapshot` doc comments on
//! `Node` carry the reasoning for the two projections that need coherent
//! `&Node` access across subsystems.
//!
//! A projection is a point-in-time copy, not a live view. The entity tables in
//! particular are mutated on the packet path between ticks, so a reader sees
//! the state as of the last publish.
//!
//! [`snapshot_dispatch`] is the seam: it serves the commands in its match arms
//! directly from the handle and returns `None` for everything else, so the
//! caller falls back to the mpsc → rx_loop path.
