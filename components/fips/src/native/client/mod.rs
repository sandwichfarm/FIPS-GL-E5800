//! A blocking client for the native datagram API, shaped like `std::net`.
//!
//! An external program links this crate and speaks the API through
//! [`FipsStream`] and [`FipsListener`] without knowing its line protocol. The
//! names, signatures and error type follow `TcpStream` and `TcpListener`,
//! because the descriptor the daemon hands back **is a real socket**: `send`,
//! `recv`, `poll`, `select`, `epoll`, `close` and `SO_RCVTIMEO` on it are the
//! genuine syscalls. Only setup is not, so setup is the part shaped to look
//! like Berkeley's.
//!
//! An address is an x-only secp256k1 public key and a port. The npub is that
//! key written down, and converting between the two is bech32 and nothing else:
//! no lookup, no resolution, no name service. The 16-byte node address on the
//! wire is a truncated hash of the key, it does not invert, and it appears
//! nowhere on this surface. [`ToFipsAddr`] is how one parameter takes every
//! spelling of the same address, exactly as `ToSocketAddrs` does.
//!
//! **A stream that outlives its connection is not representable, because the
//! connection is not an object.** [`FipsStream::connect`] opens an RPC
//! connection to the daemon socket, sends one command, receives the descriptor
//! and closes that connection. What it returns holds the descriptor and plain
//! copies of what the reply said, and no handle on anything else, which is what
//! a Berkeley setup call leaves behind. Both types are therefore `Send` and
//! `'static` with no `Arc` and no borrow.
//!
//! **The connection is read with `recvmsg` and never with a buffered reader.**
//! The daemon attaches a descriptor to the ancillary data of the same `sendmsg`
//! that carries the reply line, so a reader that consumed those bytes without a
//! control buffer would consume the descriptor into nothing. See [`Wire::fill`]
//! for the rule that decides which line a descriptor belongs to.
