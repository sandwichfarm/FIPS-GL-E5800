//! Native datagram API socket (experimental).
//!
//! A client connects to this socket, sends line-delimited JSON commands, and
//! receives line-delimited JSON replies. Both replies that succeed carry a file
//! descriptor in their ancillary data: a flow's descriptor for `connect`, a
//! listener's for `listen`. The client reads and writes datagrams on a flow's
//! descriptor with no framing of any kind, and reads one message per arriving
//! flow on a listener's.
//!
//! The API addresses a peer by public key and a service by FSP port, so a
//! datagram travels from key to key with no IPv6 emulation and no TUN device.
//! Three representations of a peer exist and only two of them are a client's:
//! the x-only public key is the address, the npub is that key written down, and
//! the 16-byte node address is a truncated hash that travels on the wire and
//! appears in no field this API hands a client.
//!
//! **The RPC connection owns nothing.** It carries setup calls and their
//! replies and then has no further part in anything it opened. A flow lives
//! until its own descriptor reaches end of file and a listener until its own
//! does, whichever task holds them, which is what makes a descriptor this API
//! hands back behave like one a syscall would have.
//!
//! **The wire is connected.** A datagram a client writes leaves this node over
//! FSP, and one arriving on a held port reaches its flow. `max_payload` is the
//! real limit: the transport MTU less the FIPS encapsulation and the four-byte
//! port header.
//!
//! **Platform support.** The listener is built on Linux, FreeBSD and macOS.
//! Windows is excluded and cannot be included: it has no `SCM_RIGHTS`, so there
//! is no way to hand a descriptor to another process at all, which is the whole
//! mechanism. macOS needed only the descriptor's socket type, since it has
//! `SCM_RIGHTS` but does not implement `SOCK_SEQPACKET` for `AF_UNIX`; see
//! [`seqpacket`] for the type it uses instead and for the measured difference
//! in how the two report a close. The gate is an explicit platform list rather
//! than `cfg(unix)` so a platform nobody has measured fails to build here
//! instead of failing at `socketpair` on a running node.
//!
//! - `protocol.rs` — the command types and the pure decisions over them. No
//!   I/O, no node state.
//! - `registry.rs` — which local ports are held and where an inbound datagram
//!   goes. Lives inside `Node`; decisions only.
//! - `link.rs` — what a client task asks the node's registry to do.
//! - `seqpacket.rs` — the socket pair behind a flow and behind a listener, the
//!   daemon half under the reactor.
//! - `fdpass.rs` — replies, arrival messages, and the `SCM_RIGHTS` hand-off of
//!   a descriptor, in both directions.
//! - `client/` — a blocking, std-only client an external program links this
//!   crate for, so it speaks the API without knowing the line protocol.

// The registry, its request types and the command types are plain decisions
// over maps and carry no socket. They build everywhere, which is what lets the
// `rx_loop` arm that serves them avoid a `cfg` — `tokio::select!` does not
// accept one. Only the listener and the descriptor machinery are gated.
