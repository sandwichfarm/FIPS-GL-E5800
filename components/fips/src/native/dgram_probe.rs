//! What a connected `AF_UNIX` `SOCK_DGRAM` pair does at end of file.
//!
//! This module is tests only. It exists to answer, by measurement on each
//! kernel rather than from the manual pages, the one question a macOS port of
//! this API turns on.
//!
//! [`super::seqpacket`] uses `SOCK_SEQPACKET`, which macOS does not implement
//! for `AF_UNIX`. The candidate replacement there is `SOCK_DGRAM`, which macOS
//! does implement and which also keeps message boundaries. What is not
//! transferable is the rule that tells a close apart from an empty datagram:
//! both produce a zero-byte read, and `seqpacket` resolves them with a latched
//! `POLLHUP` measured on Linux 6.8. Datagram poll semantics differ between
//! kernels, so that rule has to be re-established on Darwin before anything is
//! built on it.
//!
//! **The tests below assert the properties an implementation would need.** A
//! failure here is the measurement coming back negative, not a regression: it
//! says this kernel cannot support the `seqpacket` close rule on `SOCK_DGRAM`
//! and that a macOS port needs a different close signal. The same code runs on
//! every unix so the platforms can be compared without the test itself being a
//! variable.
//!
//! `SOCK_CLOEXEC` is deliberately not passed in the type argument, though
//! `super::seqpacket::pair` does pass it. Linux and FreeBSD accept it there and
//! macOS does not, and that difference belongs to the port rather than to this
//! measurement.
