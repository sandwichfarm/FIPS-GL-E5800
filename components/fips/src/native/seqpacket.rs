//! A connected `SOCK_SEQPACKET` pair, one half driven by tokio readiness.
//!
//! `SOCK_SEQPACKET` is what a datagram API wants from a local socket: it keeps
//! message boundaries, it is flow controlled, and it reports end of file when
//! the peer closes. `SOCK_STREAM` loses the boundaries and `SOCK_DGRAM` gives a
//! weaker close signal.
//!
//! Tokio ships no type for it — `UnixStream` is `SOCK_STREAM` and
//! `UnixDatagram` is `SOCK_DGRAM` — so the daemon's half is driven through
//! [`AsyncFd`], which is tokio's supported way to put an arbitrary file
//! descriptor under the reactor.
//!
//! **macOS and FreeBSD use `SOCK_DGRAM` instead**, for two different reasons
//! that come to the same thing. macOS does not implement `SOCK_SEQPACKET` for
//! `AF_UNIX` at all. FreeBSD accepts the constant and gives back a socket that
//! is not an atomic-record socket: `seqpacketproto` carries no `PR_ATOMIC` and
//! shares its send and receive handlers with `SOCK_STREAM`, so consecutive
//! messages coalesce and a zero-length message is queued nowhere and delivered
//! never. **Measured on the FreeBSD 15.1 CI image on 2026-08-22**, by the two
//! probes in [`super::dgram_probe`] named for it: a `SOCK_SEQPACKET` pair there
//! does not keep message boundaries, and it drops a zero-length message instead
//! of delivering it. The reading of the kernel source came first and the
//! measurement agreed with it; before that run the mechanism was inferred from
//! a CI log in which the zero-length-message test hung until the job was killed
//! and five boundary tests failed within 360 ms.
//! Everything else this module needs works on both: `SCM_RIGHTS` is supported,
//! `AsyncFd` is backed by kqueue, and a connected `SOCK_DGRAM` pair keeps
//! message boundaries and delivers an empty datagram, which `SOCK_SEQPACKET`
//! does on Linux and does not here.
//!
//! The two types are **not** interchangeable at end of file, and that is the
//! whole difficulty of the port. Measured 2026-08-20 and recorded in
//! [`super::dgram_probe`]: on Linux 6.8 a closed peer on a connected
//! `SOCK_DGRAM` pair produces no signal whatsoever, leaving `revents` empty and
//! `recv` returning `EAGAIN`, which is exactly what an idle socket with a live
//! peer does. Darwin does report the close. So the socket type is chosen per
//! platform and the close rule below accepts either signal rather than assuming
//! the one this kernel happens to use.

/// `POLLHUP` narrows the question and does not answer it, measured the same

/// datagram and nothing else. A closed peer does set it, **and it latches while
/// messages are still queued**: a socket holding one empty datagram from a peer
/// that has since closed reports what a drained socket reports, in `revents`,
/// in `FIONREAD`, under `MSG_PEEK` and in the `recvmsg` return alike.
///
/// So the hang-up is one of two conditions rather than the whole rule. The other
/// is [`bytes_queued`], which catches the case that costs a real payload: an
/// empty datagram with a further message behind it, read after the peer closed.
/// Without it that read reports end of file, the caller frees the flow, and the
/// message behind it is never taken.
///
/// This matters because reading an empty datagram as a close would let a client
/// tear down its own flow by sending nothing while it is still connected, and the

/// **One case survives on `SOCK_SEQPACKET`, which is Linux, and cannot be fixed
/// here.** A zero-length datagram that is the last message before a close is
/// indistinguishable from the close: reading it drains the queue, and every
/// observation then matches a bare end of file. The flow ends early and the empty
/// datagram is never delivered. Separating those needs a payload that is never
/// zero bytes on the wire, which is a protocol change rather than a receive-path
/// one. On `SOCK_DGRAM`, which macOS and FreeBSD use, the empty datagram is
/// delivered and the close is reported by the read after it; the tests below
/// pin both behaviours.
///
/// **`ECONNRESET` is treated as end of file too**, for the platform whose
/// datagram sockets report a close that way rather than through `POLLHUP`. Both
/// arms are compiled everywhere rather than split by `cfg`, because a rule that
