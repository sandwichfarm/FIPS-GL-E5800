//! A [`BleIo`] backend whose radio is supplied by the embedder.
//!
//! The two backends that came before this one own a Bluetooth stack in
//! process: `io_linux`'s `BluerIo` talks to BlueZ over D-Bus, and
//! `MockBleIo` is an in-memory double. Some platforms allow neither. On Android every BLE
//! capability this transport needs — scanning, advertising, L2CAP listen and
//! connect, and the socket I/O itself — is a Java API held under a permission
//! and foreground-service model that only the application can satisfy. There
//! is no Rust-reachable radio to open.
//!
//! So this backend does not drive a radio; it drives *the embedder's* radio.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! - [`AndroidRadio`] is the command surface the embedder implements: open a
//!   listener, dial a peer, start and stop advertising and scanning, close a
//!   channel. It is object-safe, control-plane only, and deliberately tiny.
//! - [`AndroidBleBridge`] is the channel machinery around one radio. The
//!   embedder builds it over its `AndroidRadio` and drives its `deliver_*`
//!   and [`next_send`](AndroidBleBridge::next_send) methods from whatever
//!   foreign-function layer it has; nothing in this module knows about JNI.
//! - [`BleRadioSlot`] is where a bridge is installed. The node owns one and
//!   hands out shared handles; [`AndroidIo`] resolves it per operation.
//!
//! # Bytes never cross the command surface
//!
//! Inbound bytes are **pushed** into a tokio channel by the embedder
//! ([`deliver_recv`](AndroidBleBridge::deliver_recv)) and the awaiting
//! transport task wakes. Outbound bytes are **pulled** out of a bounded queue
//! by the embedder's writer thread
//! ([`next_send`](AndroidBleBridge::next_send)), which blocks with a timeout.
//! So [`BleStream::send`] is a channel push and never makes a foreign call on
//! the byte hot path, and no foreign upcall can block a runtime worker.
//!
//! The outbound queue is bounded and shallow on purpose: see
//! [`SEND_QUEUE_CAP`].
//!
//! # A radio that arrives late, and is replaced
//!
//! The radio's lifetime is not the node's. It belongs to a service the user
//! can start and stop — turning Bluetooth on after the mesh is already
//! running, or off and on again — and each start typically mints a fresh
//! radio object. A backend that captured its radio at construction, or a
//! transport built only once a radio existed, would make "the user enabled
//! Bluetooth" mean "tear the node down and rebuild it", dropping every peer,
//! session and route for as long as re-handshaking takes.
//!
//! Hence the slot. The transport is built and started whether or not a radio
//! is present; [`AndroidIo::listen`] and [`AndroidIo::start_scanning`]
//! succeed with an empty slot and hand back an acceptor and a scanner that
//! follow it, activating the radio when one is installed and re-activating it
//! when one replaces another. Dials attempted with an empty slot fail, and
//! the transport's own probe loop retries them later. Live streams keep the
//! bridge they were opened on rather than migrating: a channel belongs to the
//! socket that created it, and those die with the radio that owned them.
//!
//! The slot is owned by a node, not by a process global. A global is simpler
//! and wrong — it collapses as soon as two nodes share a process, which
//! includes any test that drives two backends at once.
//!
//! # Testing
//!
//! Everything here is ordinary Rust; the foreign-function layer lives in the
//! embedder. The module is therefore compiled under `cfg(test)` on any host,
//! so its channel machinery, slot semantics and connect routing are unit
//! tested and linted on an ordinary CI runner against a mock radio, with no
//! device and no cross-compilation.
