//! BLE L2CAP Transport Implementation
//!
//! Provides BLE-based transport for FIPS peer communication over L2CAP
//! Connection-Oriented Channels.
//!
//! ## Packet boundaries
//!
//! Message-boundary preservation is a property of the *socket type* a
//! backend uses, not of L2CAP. BlueZ's `SOCK_SEQPACKET` preserves SDU
//! boundaries; other backends expose an L2CAP channel as a byte stream and
//! may return a fragment of a packet or several packets coalesced from one
//! read. The receive path therefore recovers boundaries from the FMP length
//! prefix via [`stream_read::BleStreamRead`] and
//! `crate::transport::framing::read_fmp_packet`, which is a transparent
//! pass-through on a boundary-preserving backend.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! Transport logic (pool, neighbor, lifecycle) is separated from any one
//! Bluetooth stack via the `BleIo` trait. `BluerIo` drives BlueZ (behind
//! `cfg(bluer_available)`), [`io_android::AndroidIo`] drives a radio the
//! embedder supplies, and `MockBleIo` is an in-memory double for tests
//! without hardware. Which one `DefaultBleTransport` resolves to is decided
//! by the cascade below, and the whole module is compiled only on platforms
//! that have one of them — see `ble_available` in `build.rs`.
//!
//! ## Connection Pool
//!
//! BLE hardware limits concurrent connections (typically 4-10). The pool
//! enforces a configurable maximum (default 7) with priority eviction:
//! static (configured) peers get priority over discovered peers.

/// A backend whose radio is supplied by the embedder rather than opened in

/// Compiled under `cfg(test)` on every host as well as on the platform that
/// will select it, so its channel machinery, slot semantics and connect
/// routing are exercised by an ordinary test run on an ordinary runner. The
/// platform build of it is linted but executed nowhere, which is exactly why
