//! BLE transport statistics.
//!
//! Counters reach an operator through `show_transports`, which serves them
//! off the control socket. Each connect outcome also emits a `debug!` at the
//! moment it happens, carrying a uniform field set — `addr`, `role`
//! (`central` for a dial, `peripheral` for an accept), `outcome` (a stable
//! kebab-case string matching the counter name), and `discovery_ms` where a
//! probe stamp exists. The counters give the aggregate; the trace stream
//! gives the same taxonomy per event and per peer.
