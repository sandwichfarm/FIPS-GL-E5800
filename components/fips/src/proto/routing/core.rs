//! Sans-IO routing decision core.
//!
//! Pure, runtime-agnostic transit-forward decision for SessionDatagrams. The
//! async I/O adapter in `node::dataplane::forwarding` decodes the wire bytes,
//! pre-resolves the next hop, builds a [`RoutingView`] over live node state,
//! calls [`Router::route`], and drives the returned [`RouteOutcome`] (the
//! actual encrypted sends, metrics, and logging). No I/O, no clock, no
//! metrics, no logging here.
//!
//! This module also holds the pure hop-selection / route-classification helpers
//! ([`select_best_candidate`], [`classify_forward`]). Selection enumerates
//! borrowed peers through the [`RoutingView`] seam, applies the bloom
//! `may_reach` and send/progress filters, and tracks the winner inline. The
//! shell hands over only raw per-peer reads; all routing narrowing and decision
//! logic lives here.
