//! Sans-IO probe stage machine.
//!
//! Pure, runtime-agnostic decisions for the `probe` diagnostic: which stage is
//! current, whether its budget has expired, whether the probe owns the session
//! it is about to tear down, and what the overall verdict is. The async driver
//! in `node::handlers::probe` builds a plain-data [`Observation`] (every clock
//! read pre-resolved into `u64`, every map read into `bool`/`Option`), calls
//! [`Probe::step`], and performs the returned [`ProbeAction`]s. No I/O, no
//! clock, no logging here.
//!
//! Time enters in three ways and is never read inside the core: `now_ms` on
//! every observation, the budgets computed once by the shell from config, and
//! the four MMP report counters — which are *counters* rather than timestamps
//! precisely so the core need not reason about when a report arrived.
