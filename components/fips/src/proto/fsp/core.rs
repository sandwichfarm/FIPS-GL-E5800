//! Sans-IO FSP session-rekey + epoch-reaction decision core.
//!
//! Pure, runtime-agnostic decisions for the FSP end-to-end session lifecycle:
//! the per-tick rekey choreography (initiator cutover, drain completion, rekey
//! trigger), rekey and initial-handshake msg3 resend classification, and the
//! post-decrypt epoch reaction. The async I/O adapters in `node::handlers::{rekey,session}` build
//! the plain-data snapshots (pre-computing every clock read into `u64`/`bool`),
//! call these decisions, and drive the returned effects — the sends, the
//! `SessionEntry` mutations, metrics, and logging. No I/O, no clock, no crypto,
//! no metrics, no logging here.
//!
//! The crypto-owning `SessionEntry` stays shell-side (`node::session`), so this
//! core carries no `proto -> noise` and no `proto -> node` dependency: the
//! trial-decrypt AEAD open runs shell-side and the resulting epoch is mapped to
//! the plain-data [`DecryptSlot`] mirror before it reaches [`Fsp::classify_epoch`].
