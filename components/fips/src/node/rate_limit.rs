//! Rate Limiting for FIPS Protocol
//!
//! Provides token bucket rate limiting for protecting against DoS attacks,
//! particularly on the Noise handshake path where msg1 processing involves
//! expensive cryptographic operations.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! - Token bucket algorithm with configurable burst and refill rate
//! - Global rate limit (not per-source, since UDP sources are spoofable)
//! - Applied before expensive DH operations in handshake processing
//!
//! ## Default Parameters
//!
//! - Burst capacity: 100 tokens (max concurrent handshakes)
//! - Refill rate: 10 tokens/second (sustained handshake rate)
//! - This allows handling burst traffic while limiting sustained attack impact
//!
//! ## Two buckets, and what the aggregate is
//!
//! Msg1 whose source matches an established link (rekey and restart
//! maintenance traffic) draws on its own bucket rather than competing with
//! stranger admission. It is *metered*, not exempted: an established-peer
//! carve-out is by construction keyed on source address, and the sentence
//! above about spoofable UDP sources is still true, so an off-path attacker
//! who can forge a live peer's `(transport_id, addr)` tuple reaches the
//! second bucket. Metering keeps that exposure bounded.
//!
//! The consequence, stated rather than left implicit: the node's total
//! admitted msg1 rate is the **sum** of the two buckets, not the stranger
//! bucket alone. At shipped defaults that is burst `100 + 128 = 228` and
//! `10.0 + 6.4 = 16.4` msg1/sec, of which the established half is only
//! reachable by a source that already matches a live link. Operators sizing
//! the handshake-crypto ceiling against a host should size against the sum.
//!
//! The concurrency limb (`max_pending`) is deliberately *not* split, so no
//! equivalent inflation happens there: one counter bounds simultaneous
//! in-flight handshake state whoever holds the slot.
//!
//! ## Why the session-setup limiter *is* keyed, when the msg1 limiter is not
//!
//! "Not per-source, since UDP sources are spoofable" is about the FMP link
//! layer, where the source is a transport address on an unauthenticated
//! datagram. [`SessionSetupRateLimiter`] sits a layer up and keys on
//! something different: the FMP link peer the datagram arrived over, which
//! the hop-by-hop Noise AEAD authenticates and whose population is bounded by
//! the peer table. Keying on the FSP `src_addr` instead would be the mistake
//! that sentence warns about, since that field is chosen by the sender and a
//! single sender can mint an unbounded number of distinct values.
