//! rather than via log scraping.
//!
//! The top-level variant set mirrors the protocol-layer / subsystem
//! split that the [`NodeStats`](crate::node::stats::NodeStats)
//! sub-structures already follow, with additional categories
//! (`Handshake`/`Session`/`Mmp`/`Forwarding`/`Transport`) for known
//! silent-rejection clusters that don't yet have dedicated stats
//! sub-structures.
