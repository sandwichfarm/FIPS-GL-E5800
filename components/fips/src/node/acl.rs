//! Peer access control lists (ACLs) keyed by npub or alias.
//!
//! Evaluation follows TCP Wrappers ordering:
//! 1. If `peers.allow` matches a peer, allow it.
//! 2. Otherwise, if `peers.deny` matches a peer, deny it.
//! 3. Otherwise, allow it.
//!
//! `ALL` acts as a wildcard entry in either file. Because allow rules are
