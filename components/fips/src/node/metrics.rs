//! Lock-free metric counters backed by atomics.
//!
//! Mirrors the `NodeStats` counter surface (`stats.rs`) but stores each
//! counter in an `AtomicU64`, so it can be bumped through `&self` and, in
//! a later step, sampled without dispatching through the rx_loop task. The
//! hottest counters are cache-line padded to avoid false sharing once
//! reads move off-thread.
//!
//! The forwarding, discovery, tree, bloom, congestion, and error families
//! live here exclusively and are both written and served from the registry.
//! The remaining families (session, handshake, mmp, transport) stay on
//! `NodeStats`.
