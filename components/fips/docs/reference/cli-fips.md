# `fips`

The FIPS mesh network daemon.

## Synopsis

```text
fips [-c FILE]
```

On Windows the same binary additionally accepts `--install-service`,
`--uninstall-service`, and (used internally by the service control
manager) `--service`.

## Description

`fips` is the FIPS daemon. It loads a YAML configuration, resolves an
identity, brings up the TUN adapter, listens on configured transports,
authenticates peers, maintains the spanning tree, and forwards mesh
traffic. There is one daemon per node.

The daemon stays in the foreground, logging to stderr, until it
receives `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`. On Windows, the service variant is
controlled through the standard service control manager.

## Options

| Flag | Argument | Description |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `-c`, `--config` | `FILE` | Use `FILE` as the configuration. Skips the default search paths. |
| `-V` | — | Print the short version, `<version> (rev <git-hash>)`. The `rev` part is omitted when the build could not read a git revision, as in a package built from a git worktree. |
| `--version` | — | Print the long version: short version plus build target triple. |
| `-h`, `--help` | — | Print usage and exit. |
| `--install-service` | — | (Windows only) Install `fips` as a Windows service. Requires Administrator. |
| `--uninstall-service` | — | (Windows only) Uninstall the Windows service. Requires Administrator. |
| `--service` | — | (Windows only, internal) Run as a Windows service. Invoked by the service control manager — not for direct use. |

There are no other CLI flags; all daemon behaviour is governed by the
YAML configuration. See [configuration.md](configuration.md).

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `0` | Clean shutdown after `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM`. |
| `1` | Failed to load configuration, resolve identity, construct the node, or start the node. The reason is printed to stderr before exit. |

## Environment

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `RUST_LOG` | Tracing filter directive. Overrides `node.log_level` from the config. Examples: `info`, `debug`, `fips=trace,fips::node::handlers::mmp=debug`. |
| `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` | Used to derive the default control-socket path when `/run/fips` does not exist. See [control-socket.md](control-socket.md). |
| `FIPS_CONFIG` | (Windows service mode only) Path to the configuration file when the daemon runs under the service control manager. |

The daemon also clamps the `nostr_relay_pool`, `nostr_sdk`, and `nostr`
log targets to `info` whenever the effective log level is below
`trace`, so that `RUST_LOG=debug` does not flood the journal with raw
relay frames. To see those frames, set the level to `trace`.

## Files

`fips` looks for `fips.yaml` in the following locations, lowest to
highest priority. All present files are merged in priority order; the
highest-priority value wins.

| Priority | Path | Purpose |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| 1 | `/usr/local/etc/fips/fips.yaml` (macOS, FreeBSD), `C:\ProgramData\fips\fips.yaml` (Windows), `/etc/fips/fips.yaml` (other Unix) | System-wide defaults |
| 2 | `~/.config/fips/fips.yaml` (`%APPDATA%\fips\fips.yaml` on Windows) | User preferences |
| 3 | `~/.fips.yaml` | Legacy user config |
| 4 | `./fips.yaml` | Deployment-specific overrides |

On macOS and FreeBSD both system directories are probed: `/etc/fips`
first, then `/usr/local/etc/fips`, so the packaged file wins over a
leftover `/etc/fips` copy from an earlier install. Windows likewise
probes `\etc\fips` on the current drive, then `C:\ProgramData\fips`.

Adjacent to the highest-priority config file the daemon keeps the
identity files:

| File | Mode | Purpose |
| ---- | ---- | ------- |
| `fips.key` | `0600` | Bech32 nsec for the persistent identity, written only in persistent mode (Unix; on Windows the file takes its directory's ACL, which `install-service.ps1` restricts to SYSTEM and Administrators). |
| `fips.pub` | `0644` | Bech32 npub of the running identity, written on every start. In persistent mode it corresponds to `fips.key`. |

When `node.identity.persistent` is `false` (the default), a fresh
keypair is generated on every start and only `fips.pub` is written.
A `fips.key` found there is moved aside to `fips.key.unused` and a
warning is logged.

On Windows the service writes its log to `C:\ProgramData\fips\fips.log`,
rolled at 10 MiB with four old files kept; a foreground run logs to the
console.

On Windows, `install-service.ps1` restricts `C:\ProgramData\fips` to
SYSTEM and Administrators. Reading or editing files there,
`fipsctl keygen`, `fipsctl address` with no argument, and a foreground
run that relies on `C:\ProgramData\fips\fips.yaml` need an elevated
prompt; unelevated, a foreground run may skip that file without saying
so or fail with an access error. Run the installer before `fipsctl keygen`,
and again after moving files into the directory, since a moved file
keeps its old permissions.

The control socket path is derived per
[control-socket.md](control-socket.md).
