# Fixture tests for await-package-runs.sh, the gate that holds the AUR publish
# until every package workflow run for the release tag has succeeded.
#
# Each case writes GitHub API responses into a fixture directory and puts a
# stub `gh` first on PATH. The stub serves <workflow>.<call>.json for the Nth
# call about a workflow, falls back to <workflow>.json, and exits 1 when the
# fixture holds a file named `gh-fails`. It counts calls per workflow so a
# case can assert that the gate polled again rather than stopping early.
#
# Needs bash and jq. Exits nonzero if any case fails or if fewer cases ran
# than are defined.
#
# Usage: bash packaging/aur/test-await-package-runs.sh
