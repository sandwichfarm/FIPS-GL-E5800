FIPS v$Version for Windows
==========================

Quick Start (foreground mode):
  .\fips.exe -c fips.yaml

Windows Service:
  # Install (requires Administrator)
  powershell -File install-service.ps1

  # Manage
  sc start fips
  sc stop fips

  # Uninstall
  powershell -File uninstall-service.ps1

TUN Support:
  Download wintun.dll from https://www.wintun.net/ and place it
  in the same directory as fips.exe. Running the daemon requires
  Administrator privileges for TUN creation.

Control Socket:
  The control socket uses TCP on localhost:21210.
  fipsctl and fipstop connect to this port automatically.

Configuration:
  The service reads C:\ProgramData\fips\fips.yaml, where
  install-service.ps1 puts it, and keeps hosts, peers.allow,
  peers.deny and, with node.identity.persistent: true, fips.key
  beside it. Edit fips.yaml there before starting the service.

  install-service.ps1 creates empty peers.allow and peers.deny
  there, which allow every peer until you add entries. To clear
  a list, empty the file; do not delete it. While either file
  is missing from C:\ProgramData\fips, the service still reads
  that file from \etc\fips on the system drive, where earlier
  releases kept it and any local user can create it. The
  installer stops if it finds a file there with none in
  C:\ProgramData\fips: review that file, move it into
  C:\ProgramData\fips or delete it, and run install-service.ps1
  again.

  install-service.ps1 restricts C:\ProgramData\fips to SYSTEM
  and Administrators before writing into it. Reading or editing
  files there, fipsctl keygen, fipsctl address with no argument,
  and a foreground fips.exe run that relies on
  C:\ProgramData\fips\fips.yaml all need an elevated prompt.
  Unelevated, a foreground run may skip that file without
  saying so, or may fail with an access error.

  A foreground run takes -c <file>, or reads
  C:\ProgramData\fips\fips.yaml and then, as per-user overrides
  the service does not read, %APPDATA%\fips\fips.yaml,
  %USERPROFILE%\.fips.yaml and .\fips.yaml. The key file sits
  beside the last config loaded.

  fipsctl keygen writes to C:\ProgramData\fips by default and
  needs an elevated prompt. Run install-service.ps1 before it:
  a directory that keygen creates first carries
  C:\ProgramData's access until the installer restricts it.

  A file moved into C:\ProgramData\fips keeps its old
  permissions. That includes a fips.yaml or fips.key moved from
  %APPDATA%\fips as the daemon's warning suggests, so run
  install-service.ps1 again after moving files there.

Logs:
  The service logs to C:\ProgramData\fips\fips.log, rolled at
  10 MiB with four old files kept. A foreground run logs to the
  console.
