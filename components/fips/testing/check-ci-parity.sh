#!/bin/bash
# ── CI parity invariant guard ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# The GitHub integration matrices (.github/workflows/ci.yml, swept across every
# job) and the local default suite set (ci-local.sh) MUST run the same
# integration suites, EXCEPT for the deliberate local-only entries listed below.
# Adding a suite to one runner without the other means "local green" and
# "GitHub green" stop being equivalent claims.
#
# Deliberate local-only (NOT on the GitHub gate), with reason:
#   tor-socks5     — requires live Tor network; opt-in via --with-tor,
#                    unreliable on GitHub-hosted runners.
#   tor-directory  — same; live Tor dependency.
#
# Deliberate GitHub-only (NOT in the local run), with reason:
#   deb-install ubuntu22 on arm64 — the local host is x86_64 and cannot run an
#                    arm64 package. The GitHub leg installs the arm64 package
#                    and starts the daemon on an arm runner.
#
# What is compared, and at what granularity:
#   chaos          — per scenario, plus its flags. GitHub fans each scenario
#                    into its own matrix leg carrying `scenario:` (and
#                    optionally `chaos_flags:`); local lists the same scenarios
#                    in CHAOS_SUITES as "display scenario flags". The `suite:`
#                    names differ cosmetically between runners and are ignored
#                    — `scenario:` is the identity.
#   deb-install    — per distro. GitHub splits into per-distro legs carrying
#                    `scenario:`, in a job of their own; local runs the same
#                    distro set in one suite, enumerated by ALL_SCENARIOS in
#                    deb-install/test.sh. A leg's `arch:` defaults to amd64,
#                    and only amd64 legs are compared with the local set, so
#                    an arm64 leg cannot stand in for a missing amd64 leg of
#                    the same distro. An arm64 leg must name a distro the
#                    local suite knows; any other arch is unidentifiable.
#   everything else — per suite name.
#
#   dns-resolver is the one leg still compared at leg granularity rather than
#   per scenario: it is a single leg and a single suite on both sides, and it
#   runs all of its scenarios internally. Its scenario list is NOT cross-checked.
#   On GitHub it is the one leg of a job of its own (it waits for the package
#   build), which the sweep across every job below finds like any other leg.
#
# The local suite set is discovered by sweeping ci-local.sh for *_SUITES arrays
# rather than from a hardcoded list of variable names, and every run_suite
# dispatch arm is then checked to have a backing array — a suite dispatched
# without one is invisible to a name-list sweep, which is how a real divergence
# went unnoticed.
#
# Exit 0 = parity clean. Exit 1 = unexpected divergence. Exit 2 = the guard
# could not run (missing file or missing dependency); never treated as a pass.
