# Deliberately not run by either runner, with the reason for each. Recorded

# "forgotten", which is what it was until 2026-07-23:
#   interop/         Manual. Driven by interop-stress.sh, which runs N
#                    repetitions serially under netem and takes far longer
#                    than a CI slot. No CI-sized entry point exists yet;
#                    writing one is the work, not adding a line here.
#   boringtun/       Comparative benchmark against a non-FIPS implementation.
#                    Measures rather than asserts, and needs a boringtun
#                    build CI does not have.
#   iperf-test.sh    Bandwidth measurement, no pass/fail. Driven manually by
#                    iperf-compare-refs.sh.
#   ecn-ab-compare.sh  Manual A/B comparison, renamed from ecn-ab-test.sh
#                    because it asserts nothing. Making it gateable needs a
#                    calibration corpus that does not exist; see its header.
#   mesh-lab/        Long-running multi-host lab, not a suite.
#   acl-allowlist/   Retired from CI 2026-07-24 as redundant, not unrunnable.
#                    The ACL decision is exhaustively unit-tested per npub over
#                    real loaded allow/deny files (src/node/acl.rs mod tests:
#                    allow-wins, allowlist-miss, deny-only, deny-all,
#                    allow_all-override), and the inbound/outbound handshake-
#                    admission path is covered in-process over loopback
#                    (src/node/tests/acl.rs). The Docker suite's only unique
#                    coverage was real-UDP admission, exercised by every other
#                    real-transport suite. Still runnable by hand:
#                    bash testing/acl-allowlist/test.sh
#   admission-cap    Retired from CI 2026-07-24 as redundant, not unrunnable.
#                    The inbound max_peers early-gate in handle_msg1 is unit-
#                    tested over a real UDP socket by
#                    handle_msg1_silent_drops_at_cap_for_new_peer in
#                    src/node/tests/unit.rs: it sends a Msg1 from a fresh
#                    identity at saturation and polls the sender socket to
#                    assert no Msg2 returns — the same wire-observable
#                    discriminator the Docker tcpdump used — plus a sibling
#                    test for the existing-peer bypass. Still runnable by hand:
#                    bash testing/static/scripts/admission-cap-test.sh
#   rekey, rekey-accept-off, rekey-outbound-only
#                    Retired from CI 2026-07-24 as redundant, not unrunnable.
#                    The rekey timing/choreography decision (trigger, K-bit
#                    cutover, drain, jitter, guards) is covered by the sans-IO
#                    poll_rekey tests (src/proto/fsp/tests/core.rs,
#                    src/proto/fmp/tests/core.rs); the data-plane continuity
#                    across a real cutover by rekey_cutover_preserves_data_plane
#                    (src/node/tests/session.rs, a real IK rekey over loopback);
#                    the accept-off dual-init regression and the
#                    udp.outbound_only rekey loop by the should_admit_msg1 and
#                    dual-init chartests (src/node/tests/handshake.rs,
#                    establish_chartests.rs). Still runnable by hand:

#   ecn-ab-on, ecn-ab-off, maelstrom, maelstrom-sparse

#                    The two maelstrom ones are 600 s stress runs kept for
#                    manual investigation. All four still load-check and
#                    carry the default max_errors ceiling if run by hand.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   — all stages passed
#   1   — one or more stages failed
#   130 — interrupted by SIGINT  (128 + 2;  run was cancelled, not a failure)
#   143 — terminated by SIGTERM  (128 + 15; run was cancelled, not a failure)
#
# A preempting CI worker maps 130/143 → "cancelled" (discard, do not record a
# failing commit), 0 → green, any other non-zero → red.
#
# Host load annotation: every failed suite in the summary is followed by the
# CPU pressure stall (/proc/pressure/cpu) over that suite's run and the peak
# number of other CI runs' containers, labelled LOAD-DEGRADED at or above
# CI_LOAD_THRESHOLD percent (testing/lib/load-annotate.py). It is context for
# reading a red and changes no verdict or exit code. The samples go to
# $FIPS_CI_LOAD_LOG if set (kept after the run), else to a per-run file that
# teardown removes.
#
# ── CI parity invariant ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# This local default suite set and the GitHub integration matrix
# (.github/workflows/ci.yml) MUST run the same integration suites, EXCEPT for
# the deliberate local-only entries below. Adding a suite to one runner
# without the other means "local green" and "GitHub green" stop being
# equivalent. testing/check-ci-parity.sh enforces this and fails on drift; it
# runs as the first stage of every local run, before the build.
#
# Deliberate local-only (NOT on the GitHub gate), with reason:
#   tor-socks5     — requires live Tor network; opt-in via --with-tor,
#                    unreliable on GitHub-hosted runners.
#   tor-directory  — same; live Tor dependency.
#
# Deliberate GitHub-only (NOT in this local run), with reason:
#   deb-install ubuntu22 on arm64 — this host is x86_64 and cannot run an
#                    arm64 package. The guard compares it by distro only and
#                    does not let it stand in for the amd64 ubuntu22 leg.
#
# The two runners express the same work in different matrix shapes, and the
# guard compares through that shape rather than around it: chaos legs are
# compared per scenario (and per flag), deb-install legs per distro. The one
# leg still compared at leg granularity is dns-resolver — a single suite on
# both sides that runs all of its scenarios internally. On GitHub it is a job
# of its own, because it runs the package's binaries and so waits for the
# package build.

# Scenarios retired 2026-07-23 because their subject was a pure decision the
# Docker harness could not test reliably, now covered by sans-IO unit tests:
#   - cost-reeval, cost-avoidance, cost-stability, depth-vs-cost,
#     mixed-technology, bottleneck-parent: the evaluate_parent() cost/depth/
#     hysteresis decision (root election, MMP measurement lag and hold-down
#     timing all confounded the assertions) -> src/tree/tests.rs.
#   - congestion-drops (never landed): the SO_RXQ_OVFL detection edge. A
#     fresh daemon reader keeps up with container-speed traffic, so the
#     socket overflow could not be provoked deterministically; the FIPS
#     detection logic is now unit-tested in src/node/tests/unit.rs.
# congestion-stress stays: it exercises the ECN/MMP congestion signals,
# which do need the real shaped bottleneck queue.
#
# Retired 2026-07-24 for a different reason — redundant, not unreliable:
#   - smoke-10: a no-stressor 10-node tree-convergence sanity check (netem
#     off, no ping). The convergence logic it exercised is covered in-process,
#     faster and deterministically, by the loopback spanning-tree harness
#     (src/node/tests/spanning_tree.rs: ring/star/chain/100-node/disconnected)
#     plus end-to-end datagram delivery (src/node/tests/forwarding.rs). Real-
#     UDP convergence smoke still runs via static-mesh and the other chaos
#     scenarios' baseline assertions, so no Docker coverage is lost.
#
# Retired 2026-07-26 for a third reason — the guard's power was never
# established, and unlike the two blocks above this one DOES lose coverage:
#   - bloom-storm: guarded the regression in 0caef2a (fixed by 4cdf382), where
#     a mid-chain tree update changing neither root nor depth leaked downstream
#     as a sustained bloom announce storm. It was never once run against that
#     regressed binary; its ceiling was inferred from a separate post-mortem
#     harness that no longer exists in the tree. On the only regressed
#     measurement that survives, the tail node's rate scales to ~7 sends per
#     30s, well under the scenario's ceiling of 40 — so it is not established
#     that the assertion could ever have fired on its own bug class. The
#     ceiling is also uniform per node, calibrated against the flap target
#     (legitimately ~24) while the storm's actual signature is at the tail,
#     which sits at 0 on fixed code. COVERAGE GAP: nothing now exercises
#     downstream containment of a mid-chain ancestor swap. The scenario, its
#     README, the link_swap sim primitive and the mesh-lab dispatch all stay
#     on disk and it remains runnable by hand via
#     testing/chaos/scripts/chaos.sh bloom-storm.

# space and the second died with `Pool overlaps`. Claim a free /24 for each
# instead and let docker's own create be the atomic arbiter, exactly as
# claim_gateway_lan6 and sidecar's alloc_network do. The run-id-derived offset
# this task considered earlier stays rejected: it makes a collision unlikely
# rather than impossible, and a collision is the failure being removed.
#
# 10.41.0.0/16 is unclaimed in-tree, sits below this host's docker pool
# (10.128.0.0/9, per /etc/docker/daemon.json), and is also outside docker's
# stock 172.17-31 / 192.168 default, so the choice holds either way.

# The claim lives here rather than in the suite scripts because
# .github/workflows/ci.yml invokes nat-test.sh, nostr-relay-test.sh and
# stun-faults-test.sh directly and testing/mesh-lab/run-loop.sh invokes
# `nat-test.sh lan`; none of those want a claim, and all tear down with the
# base compose file only.
#
