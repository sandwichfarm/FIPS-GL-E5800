"""Native datagram API client for the increment checks.

Speaks the line-delimited JSON command protocol on the daemon's native API
socket. A run takes a script: a list of steps sent over ONE connection. The
connection owns nothing — a flow lives until its own descriptor is closed, and a
listener until its own is — so the single connection is a convenience for the
checks rather than a lifetime the daemon respects. Descriptors are what keep
things alive, and this tool holds them until the step that closes them or until
it exits.

Kinds of step:

  RPC step:  {"command": str, "params": {...}?, "expect": {"dotted.key": val}?,
              "settle": bool?,
              "keep_fd": name?, "keep_listener": name?, "keep_flow": name?}
             Sends a command and checks the reply. `keep_fd` stores a flow
             descriptor under that name, `keep_listener` a listener descriptor;
             every reply that carries one must name it, because a descriptor
             nothing named is a flow or a port silently dropped. `keep_flow`
             stores the reply's data.flow_id.

             A parameter or expectation whose value is the string "@name" is
             replaced by the flow identifier stored under `name`. Identifiers
             are assigned by the node and keep counting up for its lifetime, so
             a check that asserted a literal 1 would hold only for the first
             flow the daemon ever made.

  Accept step: {"accept": listener, "keep_fd": name, "expect": {...}?,
                "keep_flow": name?}
             One recvmsg on a stored listener descriptor. There is no accept
             command: an arriving flow is one SOCK_SEQPACKET message on the
             listener itself, carrying the flow's descriptor as ancillary data
             and the arrival object as its payload. Expectations are checked
             against that object, whose peer is an npub and never a hex address.

  Sleep step: {"sleep": seconds}
             Holds every descriptor open for a while, which is what a check that
             reads the daemon's own view of a live flow needs.

  Flow step: {"fd": name, ...} operating on a stored descriptor:
               "write": hex, "repeat": n?   send n datagrams of those bytes
               "read": n, "expect_bytes": hex?, "sizes": [..]?
                                            read n datagrams and check them
               "readable": bool             check poll readability now
               "close": true                close the descriptor
             `readable` and `close` work on a listener descriptor too: a
             listener is pollable, and closing it unbinds its port.

Reading is per-datagram: the descriptor is SOCK_SEQPACKET, so one recv is one
datagram. A check that reads three and gets one concatenated blob is a real
failure, not a quirk of the tool.

Usage:
  client.py --socket PATH --script '<json list of steps>'
  client.py --socket PATH --script-file steps.json

Exit 0 when every expectation holds, 1 otherwise, 2 on a connection failure.
