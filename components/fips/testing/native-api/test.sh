# Native datagram API checks (experimental feature).
#
# The client runs in its own container and reaches the daemon through a
# bind-mounted /run/fips. That is the real deployment shape: a separate process
# with its own filesystem opening the socket, rather than a test speaking to the
# daemon from inside its own container. It is also what makes the access policy
# observable — the host sees the socket file and can read its mode.
#
# The setup protocol is two commands and two descriptors. `connect` hands back
# a flow's SOCK_SEQPACKET half; `listen` hands back the listener's own, which is
# what makes a listener pollable and makes accepting a recvmsg on it rather than
# a round trip on the command socket. There are no events and no accept or
# reject command: an arriving flow is one message on the listener descriptor,
# carrying that flow's descriptor with it, and refusing a flow is close(2).
#
# Every check that receives a descriptor names it. The harness treats a
# descriptor nothing named as a failure rather than ignoring it, because an
# unnamed one is a flow or a held port dropped with nothing to say so.
#
# A peer is named by npub everywhere a client can see it, in a connect reply and
# in an arrival alike. The 16-byte node address is the wire's and appears only
# on the operator surface, which is why the control-socket check below asserts
# both and the client checks assert only the npub.
#
# The observability check reads the daemon's own view back out through the
# control socket. That needs nothing added to the image: the control socket is
# enabled by default and lands in the same bind-mounted /run/fips, and the image
# already carries python3 for the API client.
#
# inject, stats and arrive are debug commands, gated on
# node.native_api.debug_commands and off in a packaged node. node.yaml turns
# them on because nine checks here drive them; check_debug_commands_gated runs a
# second node that leaves the key alone and asserts all three are refused there.
#
# The echo check runs examples/native-echo.rs, which is built against the
# crate's own client module rather than against the line protocol. That makes it
# the only check here where both ends are programs a user could have written.
# examples/native-surface.rs is the second such program: it walks the client's
# whole public surface against a live daemon and asserts what each item reports,
# which is the coverage a check driven from the Python line-protocol client
# cannot give. Both image paths carry both binaries; see resolve_image and
# testing/docker/Dockerfile.
#
# Usage: ./test.sh
#
# Image: FIPS_TEST_IMAGE if set (this is what ci-local.sh passes, and there is
# deliberately no fips-test:latest to fall back on). Otherwise a minimal image
# is built from locally compiled binaries, which is the standalone path.

# container. It has to be somewhere the Docker daemon can resolve, which /tmp
# is not always.
#
# A bind-mount source is resolved by the daemon in the host's mount namespace,
# never in this script's. Under a service sandbox that gives the unit a private
# /tmp — systemd's PrivateTmp=, which the CI worker on the builder sets — a path
# from `mktemp -d` exists only here. The daemon finds nothing at it and creates
# an empty directory instead, so a socket the container binds lands where this
# script cannot see it, and a file mount such as fips.yaml arrives as a
# directory, which the daemon reports as EISDIR. Neither says what happened:
# the first surfaces as "socket never appeared" and the second as a node that
# will not start. The suite failed both ways on the builder while passing on
# GitHub, whose runner has no such sandbox.

# The worktree is the same path in both namespaces, so putting these
