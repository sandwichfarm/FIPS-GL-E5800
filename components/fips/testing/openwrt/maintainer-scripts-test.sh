# ── OpenWrt maintainer-script scenarios ─────────────────────────────────────
# Runs testing/openwrt/scenarios.sh inside a busybox container, so the package
# scripts and the fips-gateway init script are interpreted by ash rather than
# by the host's bash or dash. The scripts ship to routers and are only ever run
# under ash there; a construct bash accepts and ash does not would otherwise
# surface on a router.
#
# The container is the only reason docker is needed: the scenarios touch no
# network and no FIPS binary, and they do not use the shared test image.
#
# Exit 0 = every scenario passed. Exit 1 = at least one failed. Exit 2 = the
# harness could not run; never treated as a pass.

# daemon can see: under the checkout, not /tmp, which a service running with a
# private /tmp (as the CI workers do) does not share with the daemon.
