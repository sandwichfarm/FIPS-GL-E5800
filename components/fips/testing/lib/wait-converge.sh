# Shared convergence wait helpers for FIPS integration tests.
#
# Source this file to get wait_for_peers() and wait_until_connected().
#
# Usage:
#   source "$(dirname "$0")/../../lib/wait-converge.sh"
#   wait_for_peers <container> <min_peers> [timeout_secs]
#   wait_until_connected <ping_fn> <max_secs> <stall_secs> [poll_secs] \
#       [near_converged_slack] [near_converged_accept_secs]
#
# wait_until_connected also sets CONVERGE_OUTCOME / CONVERGE_REACHED /
# CONVERGE_PENDING; see the block above it.
#
# There was a wait_for_links() here. It was removed rather than kept for
# symmetry: it had no caller anywhere in the tree on any branch, and its
# reader carried the same failure-to-zero fallback wait_for_peers does. An
# uncalled helper cannot be wrong today, so the risk was that the first
# caller to appear would inherit the hazard below without the reasoning
# that goes with it. `git log` has the implementation if one is needed.

# Wait until a container has at least min_peers connected peers.
# Returns 0 on success, 1 on timeout.
#
# The read below falls back to 0 when the container does not answer, which
# is safe ONLY because this is a floor: a fallback of 0 reads as "not
# converged yet", the loop keeps polling, and a container that never answers
# times out and returns 1. That safety is a property of the comparison, not
# of the reader.
#
# A minimum of 0 inverts it. `[ 0 -ge 0 ]` is true, so the first read from a
# dead container would satisfy the wait immediately and the caller would
# proceed as though convergence had been observed. No caller passes 0, and
# rejecting it here means none can start to — which is cheaper than auditing
# every future caller, and is why this is a hard error rather than a warning.
# A caller that genuinely wants to assert "exactly zero peers" needs a reader
# that distinguishes no-answer from zero, not this floor.

# Verdict of the most recent wait_until_connected() call, so a caller can
# report WHICH condition failed rather than only that one did:
#   CONVERGE_OUTCOME  converged | near_converged | stalled | timeout
#   CONVERGE_REACHED  reachable pairs at the moment of the verdict
#   CONVERGE_PENDING  unreachable pairs at that moment
#
# These exist because the gate's own probe is strictly harsher than the
# assertion it guards, so a run can fail the gate at 18/20 and then pass
# the strict all-pairs assertion 20/20. Without them the caller's summary
# line reads "20 passed, 0 failed" on a non-convergence exit, which a
# reader cannot tell from a connectivity failure.
#
# near_converged is a success return (0): the hard cap fell while the mesh
# had held within slack for at least near_converged_accept_secs, and the
# caller asked for that state to be handed to its own strict assertion.

#
# <ping_fn> is the name of a function that runs the suite's own
# connectivity check and sets two globals each call:
#   PASSED  number of reachable pairs this round
#   FAILED  number of unreachable pairs this round
#
# The convergence signal is the suite's real pings (the same signal it
# asserts on), not a structural proxy. Behaviour:
#   - converged: FAILED == 0  -> return 0.
#   - progressing: PASSED climbed past the best seen -> reset the stall
#     clock and keep waiting (slow-but-improving is not a failure, so it
#     does not false-time-out under CI load).
#   - stuck: PASSED has not improved for stall_secs -> return 1 (fail
#     fast rather than burn the whole budget on a genuinely wedged pair),
#     BUT only when FAILED > near_converged_slack (default 2). A mesh
#     that is genuinely far from convergence still bails fast on stall.
#   - near-converged hold: when FAILED <= near_converged_slack and the
#     stall window has elapsed, do NOT bail. A handful of straggling
#     pairs (e.g. a deep node whose last pair clears only after stacked
#     discovery backoff + late bloom propagation) is a rare timing event,
#     not a routing defect, so the gate keeps polling toward max_secs
#     rather than emitting a false RED with budget still unspent. A
#     genuinely never-converging single pair still hits the hard cap.
#   - hard cap: max_secs elapsed -> return 1 (never runs unbounded).
#   - near-converged acceptance, off unless near_converged_accept_secs is
#     non-zero: at the hard cap, if the current near-converged hold has
#     lasted at least that long and the last poll was still within slack,
#     return 0 with verdict near_converged instead. It acts only at the cap,
#     a state that is red without it, so it can never turn a run that would
#     have converged by the cap into a red one. Acceptance means "hand the
#     mesh to the caller's strict assertion", never "skip that assertion".
#     Progress disarms the hold, so only the hold that ends at the cap counts.
#
# Returns 0 once fully connected or accepted as near-converged, 1 on stall
# or timeout.
