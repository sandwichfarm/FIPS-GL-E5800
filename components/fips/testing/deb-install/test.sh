# Test the fips Debian package install path across target distros.
#
# Each scenario takes the .deb from --deb, or builds (or reuses) it
# through packaging/debian/build-deb-container.sh, boots a systemd
# container with TUN access for the target distro, installs the .deb
# via `apt install ./fips_*.deb`, waits for fips.service + fips-dns.service
# to come up, and verifies that `dig @127.0.0.53 AAAA <npub>.fips`
# returns a non-empty AAAA answer through the resolver backend that
# fips-dns-setup configured. Then exercises fips-gateway against the
# same daemon to verify the gateway/daemon default-pairing. Finally it
# purges the package with the DNS routing file planted and fips-dns
# stopped, and checks the file is removed and systemd-resolved restarted.
#
# This is the most thorough test surface — it exercises:
#   - cargo deb packaging (binary stripping, dependency declaration)
#   - dpkg conffile placement (/etc/fips/fips.yaml)
#   - postinst maintainer scripts (systemd unit enablement,
#     fips-dns.service running fips-dns-setup)
#   - postrm purge (removing the DNS routing fips-dns-setup wrote)
#   - The fips, fips-dns, and (optionally) fips-gateway systemd units
#   - End-to-end .fips resolution as a real user would experience it
#
# Usage: ./test.sh [scenario ...]
#   No args = run all scenarios.
#   Named args = run only those (e.g., ./test.sh ubuntu26 debian12)
#
# Requirements: Docker able to grant SYS_ADMIN and NET_ADMIN and an
# unconfined AppArmor profile (the containers are not privileged; see
# testing/lib/systemd-container.sh), /dev/net/tun on the host (standard).

# given a higher Version and repacked, so the upgrade runs this tree's prerm
# and postinst without a second build.

# Its runtime image holds no package. The install scenario's image does, but
# under a tag every run shares and a file name every build of one version
# shares, so another run could retag it in the minutes between the two
# scenarios and this one would upgrade from that run's package. Instead the
