# Assert that ONE log line in $container contains every one of the given
# fixed strings.
#
# Single-line matching is the point. Independent whole-log greps for an
# npub and for `decision=denylist match` are jointly satisfied by "this
# npub appears somewhere" plus "somebody was rejected by denylist", which
# is not the property this suite exists to prove. Node-a lists the denied
# peers as auto_connect peers, so it logs their npubs on the outbound
# connect path whether or not a rejection ever happened; the npub has to
# be on the rejection line itself to mean anything.
#
# Strings match in any order, by chaining fixed-string greps over the
# surviving lines, so the assertion does not depend on the order the
# tracing formatter emits a message and its fields in. A grep over empty
# input yields the empty string rather than a value that could satisfy
# the caller, so a container that cannot be read times out and fails
# rather than passing.
#
# Polls rather than reading once: under the XX handshake the
# cross-connection tie-breaker decides which side reaches its ACL check
# first, so an inbound-handshake rejection may not emit until a later
# retry. Same wait-with-timeout shape as wait_for_peers_exact above.
#
# Deliberately NOT registered in check-log-strings.py's SHELL_HELPERS,
# for two reasons, and note that registering it would in fact capture
# nothing: that extractor reads only a helper's FIRST argument and only
# when it is a quoted literal free of `$` (check-log-strings.py:116),
# whereas the first argument here is the unquoted container name
# carrying ${FIPS_CI_NAME_SUFFIX}. Verified by running the extractor
# with this helper added: zero hits. The same is true of the
# `assert_log_contains` this replaced, so nothing left the check's scope.
#
# It should stay out of scope regardless: that check exists for strings
# whose disappearance from src/ would let an assertion silently pass,
# and every string here is a positive requirement, so a missing one
# exhausts the poll and exits 1, which is loud.

# fully-formed rejection line for each on the outbound_connect path.
# These two assertions are therefore satisfiable without the inbound ACL
# check running at all. The suite still catches that, because the denied
# peer would then connect and the peer-count assertions above would time
# out; but these two lines alone do not prove the inbound path.
