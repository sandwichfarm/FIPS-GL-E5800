# Integration test for the fips0 nftables baseline (packaging/common/fips.nft).
#
# Asserts the four behaviors documented in the fips.nft header:
#   (a) unallowed inbound on fips0  → DROP
#   (b) outbound-initiated reply    → conntrack established/related ACCEPT
#   (c) ICMPv6 echo-request         → ACCEPT
#   (d) drop-in allowlisted port    → ACCEPT
#
# fips-firewall.service activation: the unit's ExecStart is
# `/usr/sbin/nft -f /etc/fips/fips.nft`. The test image does not run
# systemd, so this script invokes the same nft command directly inside
# the container after fips0 is up. The full deb-install harness covers
# the systemd unit-enablement path separately.
#
# Usage: ./test.sh [--skip-build] [--keep-up]
