"""Find shell functions that end in a logging call and whose status a caller tests.

A bash function's exit status is the status of its last command. A function
whose last statement is `echo`/`log`/`info`/... therefore returns 0 on every
path that reaches the end, and any caller written as `if func`, `func || fail`
or `func && ...` has a gate that cannot fire.

This is not hypothetical and not a style rule. Two instances were found in one
day in this tree:

  * `run_chaos` ended in `record`, whose own last statement is an `echo`, so
    every chaos row was unconditionally green from 2026-03-09.
  * `build_fips_for_e2e` ended in `log`, so a failed binary extraction left the
    previous run's cache in place and five end-to-end legs tested the previous
    commit's code and reported green — a green run certifying software that was
    never built.

Both were repaired individually. This exists so the next one is caught by a
gate rather than by a reader.

WHAT IT ENFORCES, stated precisely, because it is a convention and not a bug
hunt: a function whose exit status a caller tests must END WITH AN EXPLICIT
`return`. It must not leave its success value to be whatever the last logging
call happened to produce.

That is deliberately stricter than "has a bug". Every instance in the tree when
this check was written was in fact benign -- each failure path already returned
early, so the trailing `echo` reported a genuine success. The point is that
reading the function is the only way to know that, and the next edit that adds
an unguarded command before the final log turns a benign shape into the exact
defect above with nothing to notice it. An explicit terminal `return` costs one
line and makes the class unreachable.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT FLAG: a function ending in a logging call whose
status nobody consumes. That is idiomatic and harmless — a reporting helper is
supposed to end by reporting. The defect needs both halves, and scoping on the
call sites rather than on the definitions is what keeps the finding list short
enough to stay read. Same reasoning as check-log-strings.py scoping on what a
grep reads rather than on what its file mentions.

Exit codes:
    0 — no function has both the shape and a status-testing caller
    1 — at least one does
    2 — the checker could not run (bad tree, unreadable file)
