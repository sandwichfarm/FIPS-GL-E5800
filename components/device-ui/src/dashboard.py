"""Interactive dual-city status dashboard for the GL-E5800's built-in screen.

Four main panels reached by swiping left/right: world clock, currency,
active SIM, and OpenClash. Tapping into a panel opens a sub-screen (city
picker, currency picker, data-cap picker, or the OpenClash on/off + mode
control) -- tap the header to go back, or swipe right. Writes RGB565
frames directly to /dev/fb0.

Usage:
  dashboard.py            run the live loop, drawing to /dev/fb0
  dashboard.py --preview  render every screen to PNG files in the given
                          directory (plus a contact sheet), for visual QA
  dashboard.py --calibrate  flash solid red/green/blue full-screen for
                          1s each, to verify the framebuffer colour
                          channel order on real hardware

# ---------- WireGuard ----------

# The wgclient/ifup mechanism below this comment used to be the whole
# story -- reading /lib/netifd/proto/wgclient.sh alone, it looks complete:
# create a `network.wgclient` interface with proto=wgclient and
# config=<peer section>, and the proto script pulls keys/endpoint/
# allowed_ips live from that wireguard.<peer> section at ifup time.
#
# That is true for a peer added by hand in LuCI. It is NOT true for any
# of the 284 peers a real device importing NordVPN's server list ended up
# with -- confirmed live, by diffing this router's uci config before and
# after two real connections made from the stock GL.iNet app (Japan, then
# Switzerland). Those peers carry only host_id/group_id/location; there
# is no public_key or endpoint anywhere for netifd to work with, and
# /etc/wireguard/profile/ (where a resolved peer's real config gets
# written) had never even been created. Tapping one of these in the old
# implementation wrote network.wgclient.config and called `ifup` exactly
# as intended -- and the interface sat at pending:true, up:false forever,
# because there was nothing there for it to actually connect with.
#
# The real mechanism (confirmed by watching what changed after the app's
# own connects, then independently reproduced from a cold SSH session for
# a peer never touched through the app at all -- up:true within ~8s):
# GL.iNet's own "AutoVPN" policy-routing feature owns this. There is one
# `route_policy` section of type "rule" (named "Primary Tunnel" by
# default) that carries the live VPN route; connecting a specific peer
# means writing that RULE's group_id/peer_id (the bare numeric id, e.g.
# "2116" for wireguard.peer_2116) and enabled=1, then restarting the
# separate `vpn-client` service. That service (its rtp2.sh) is what
# authenticates against the group's stored token, fetches the real key
# material, writes network.wgclientN itself, and brings the tunnel up --
# none of which this dashboard needs to (or safely could) replicate
# itself. Turning the connection off is the same rule with enabled=0.

# hub listing all four titles with best scores) -- NOT swipeable
# themselves. Each game is its own `view == "game"` sub-screen (same
# family as "more"/"repeater"/"sms": it owns touch completely while
# active) so none of them fight the main carousel's own swipe-to-page
# gesture, which several of these games would otherwise collide with
# (2048's swipe-to-merge most obviously, but even Snake's directional
# input sits close enough to a swipe to be ambiguous).
#
# All four share one on-screen contract: a persistent Exit pill in the
# chrome bar (top-right, same spot in every game) always returns to the
# hub -- tapping it never needs to be preceded by finding a header/back
# gesture first, and it's the same gesture regardless of which game is
# running or what state it's in (playing, paused, game over).
#
# Frame budget: measured live on this hardware -- new_canvas + a handful
# of shapes/text + RGB565 convert + fb0 write costs ~23ms/frame (~44fps
# ceiling). All continuous games run at 25fps (40ms), leaving comfortable
# headroom; Snake only needs to redraw on its own ~130ms movement step,
# since nothing changes on screen between steps.
