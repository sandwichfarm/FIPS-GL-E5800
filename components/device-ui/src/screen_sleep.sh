# Real hardware screen sleep/wake for the built-in display (not a fake
# black frame). Saves/restores the previous brightness level.
#
# There are THREE independently-controlled pieces of hardware state here,
# found the hard way after "screen won't wake / flashes then goes dark"
# survived several rounds of fixing the power-button press detection:
#   - brightness (.../soc:backlight/brightness) -- backlight PWM duty
#     cycle. This is all any earlier version of this script ever touched.
#   - bl_power   (.../soc:backlight/bl_power) -- backlight power gate,
#     FB_BLANK semantics (0 = on, nonzero = off), managed independently by
#     GL.iNet's own /etc/gl_screen/platform.sh (get_backlight_state) --
#     not something this project ever wrote to.
#   - fb0/blank  (/sys/class/graphics/fb0/blank) -- the LCD controller's
#     own blank/sleep state. This panel is SPI-attached (fb0's device
#     symlink points at .../spi0.0), so it has hardware sleep/wake
#     commands entirely separate from backlight. THIS is the one that
#     actually determines whether the panel renders anything -- confirmed
#     live: with brightness=59 and bl_power=1 the screen was dark, writing
#     fb0/blank=0 lit it instantly with nothing else changed, and
#     fb0/blank=1 blanked it again. Something else on this device (not
#     part of this project) blanks fb0 independently of brightness, which
#     is the actual reason the screen could look "on" by brightness's
#     account while genuinely being dark, no matter how correctly the
#     button-press logic itself worked.
#
# fb0/blank reads back empty (appears write-only), so it can't be used to
# track current state -- brightness is used as that proxy for
# toggle/status instead, same as before. Since "on" always explicitly
# force-unblanks regardless of assumed prior state, this self-corrects
# within one on/off cycle even if something else blanked fb0 in between.

# Persistent, not /tmp: the saved level is the user's chosen brightness,
# and losing it on every reboot meant the next wake jumped to
# max_brightness instead of back to whatever they had set.
